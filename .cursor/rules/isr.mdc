Title: ISR/SSR Rules (MDC)

Rendering:
- Prefer static generation for stable pages; dashboard may use client data hydration
- Avoid heavy computation in server components; push analysis to client where possible
- Keep analysis engines (Stockfish) strictly client-side; no server runtime dependency

Data:
- Use DatabaseContext for client storage; do not access IndexedDB on server
- Respect Next.js route boundaries; keep cross-page state in context or URL params

Build/Agent:
- Use `npm run build:agent` for isolated builds in CI/agent flows to avoid dev server interference
